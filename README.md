# PRODIGY_DS_02

## About
This project focuses on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of MODIS satellite data related to wildfires in Turkey. The goal is to explore relationships between variables, identify patterns, and gain insights into wildfire occurrences.

## Project Structure
- **`turkey-wildfires.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the data cleaning and EDA process.
- **`fire_nrt_M_C61_212465_all_countries.csv.zip`**: Compressed CSV file with MODIS satellite data.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Theconjecture/PRODIGY_DS_02.git
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook and other dependencies installed. You can use `requirements.txt` if provided.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:
    Open `turkey-wildfires.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to see the data cleaning and EDA process.

## Analysis
The analysis in the notebook includes:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Summary statistics and distributions of key variables.
  - Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts to understand data patterns.
  - Correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables.
  - Analysis of specific attributes such as FRP (Fire Radiative Power), brightness temperature, and their distributions.

## Results
Key findings and visualizations from the EDA are included in the notebook. These insights help in understanding the patterns and trends in wildfire data in Turkey, such as:
- Distribution of fire radiative power (FRP) and its implications.
- Relationships between brightness temperature and fire occurrences.
- Identification of high-risk areas and times for wildfires.
